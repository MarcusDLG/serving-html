      <h1>Giuseppe's Generous Gnocchi</h1>
      <p>
        At Giuseppe's, we do Italian food just the way mama made it when we were
        kids. While we focus on our freshly-made pasta, our coal fired pizza
        oven spits out pizza that is second to none. When you are here, you are
        family, and that is why we expect you to clean up after yourselves in a
        timely manner.

      <h3>Pizza</h3>
      <p>
        Everything that goes into our pizzas is the best it can be. Our dough is
        made from scratch and hand-kneaded to create each crust. We use only
        select california tomatoes, blended with our secret italian herbs and
        spices, to create our satisfyingly robust pizza sauce. Even the
        mozzarella cheese that tops our pizzas is special. I

      <h2>Pasta Challenge Winner</h2>

        <img class="smallPic" src="./Images/Jimbob.jpg" />
        <p>
          JimBob Cooter has been a long time fan of food challenges and has not
          shied away from this one. If he's not directing Matty Stafford to whip
          a ball downfield, he's at a restaurant trying to expand his stomach.
          That means that this man was ready to take on the 4 pound challenge!
          <br />
          <br />

          The four pound challenge consists of consuming 4 pounds of elk meat
          spaghetti made with our fresh pasta and our owner harvested elk meat.
          You have 2 hours to finish your plates or your meal isn't free, so
          work fast but smart! In order to take over the spot on the website,
          then you must finish all four pounds in under 1hr and 36 minutes. All
          times are rounded to the next nearest minute, and tenths and
          hundredths of seconds will be used only for record-breaking
          measurement.
